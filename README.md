**4242.tech** is a simple command-line markdown wiki to access command line cheatsheets, to simplify your life at 42 School.
To use it, you just have to:
```
curl 4242.tech/help
```

## How does it works?
It simply uses a Makefile to build static ansi text files, using the [cli-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cli-markdown) NPM module.
The Nginx configuration then redirects the user depending on the user agent he uses.
